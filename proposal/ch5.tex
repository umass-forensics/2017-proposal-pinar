\chapter{Timeline}
I plan to produce a draft by the beginning of Fall 2017, and defend by the end of that semester. Several significant efforts remain to complete these studies.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Submit my recent work on throughput localization (Chapter~2) to a journal (March 2017).
	\item Investigate utility and information theory models for location privacy (April 2017)
	\item Find relevant datasets available for academic research and evaluate location profiling and trajectory linking algorithms (May 2017).
	\item Investigate simlabTrace as a way to implement Spartacus (May 2017)
	\item Develop an experiment to evaluate methods of purchasing targeted advertisements based on sports teams and performers, and de-anonymizing users based on information from co-travelers (March 2017).
	\item Data collection of advertisements (March -- June 2017).
	\item Develop a data collection protocol and perform a field survey of Amherst and surrounding area (March -- May 2017).
	\item Synthesize a dataset and evaluate these algorithms using surveyed data (June 2017).
	\item Use the dataset to simulate scenarios for ZipPhone and Spartacus (July 2017).
\end{enumerate}
